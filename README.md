I got bored and wrote a md handler for Claude AI API, modify the prompt.md file, and response.md will be filled, the prompts and responses will be catalogged in a file called backlog.md when you create a new prompt. Some common issues, the prompt needs to be all 1 line, if you have multiple lines you will receive and error, and it will be logged. (Basic ass error handling dont expect much)
